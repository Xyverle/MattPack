![](preview.png)
The texture pack used by mattbatwings.

[mattbatwings](https://www.youtube.com/@mattbatwings) did not create any of these textures. This is an accumulation of multiple packs such as [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/) and [Codecrafted](https://codecrafted.net/)

Features
 * Iron trapdoors on the top block will be turned into lamps. The regular lamps branch removes this.
